#SRH_Software-Development-LebaneseFoodRestaurant
This website will contain many different features:
First of all i will be creating a menu that contains a variety of Lebanese food with some other additions with the price for each dish
Then we will have a map showing the exact location of the restaurant
Of course there will be also a delivery option
So we will be using the most known ways of online payments
Finally we would love to hear our costumers feedback so we will let them send us a review about the experience they had and the food

## FINAL PROJECT SUBMISSION

## 1. Git

>Use and understand Git! Play with Branches and undo/revert things = go back in time!

&rarr; [See commit history here](https://github.com/Majdhijazi/Software-development/commits?author=Majdhijazi)
&rarr; [Second branch/firstcheck](https://github.com/Majdhijazi/Software-development/commits/firstcheck)


## 2. UML 

>UML at least 3 good different big diagrams. "good" means you can pump it up artificially as written in DDD. You have 10 million $ from me! Please export the pics. I can not install all the tools to view them! Perfect would be 1) one dynamic diagram like an activity diagranm 2) one or two static diagrams as component, class or deployment and if needed a use-case diagram.
 ### Activity Diagamm

## 3. Requirements Engineering

>Describe your project or any project (e.g. one related to your work or a private project) neatly using the methods of Requirements Engineering by mapping some requirements in 2 tools (!).To do this, use the most important description attributes from the script! Approximately 5-10 requirements per tool should be sufficient. Two variants should be provided = tools. A 'self-made' version and a professional = possibly commercial version, i.e. with 2 tools! Examples of 'self-made' variants: Airtable, notion.so, Trello, etc. Examples of commercial tools: Monday, Jira, Doors, ObjectIF, Xebrio, etc. (see Miro). Instead of the professional version, you can also build a tool yourself.

## 4. Analysis

>From all the points in the Analysis learning unit, A) come up with your own checklist (on an extra DIN A4 page) with the points that you consider relevant to your project. B. Carry out an analysis of your semester project/your favourite / start-up idea and would like to submit this analysis as part of a large documentary! Write enough about each point to create at least 2 pages. Assume that you will soon have an angel for the start-up chapter. If successful, you would get a lot of “money” to be able to do the design and implement it later. So get your start-up successfully into the race!

|TODO|

## 5. DDD

>DDD Do a DDD session to find your domains! If your domain is too small, invent other domains around and document these domains (as if you have 100 Mio € from Edlich-Investment!) Develop a clear strategic design with mappings/relationships with >=8 Domains coming from an A) Event Storming. Drop your Domains into a B) Core Domain Chart and draw the C) Relations between the Domains!  

|TODO|

## 6. Metrices

>Metrics at least two. Sonarcube would be great. Other non-trivial metrics are also fine.

|TODO|

## 7. Clean Code Dev

>Clean Code Development: A) At least 5 points you can show me with an explanation of why this is clean code in your code and/or what has improved & B) >>10 points on your personal CCD cheat sheet. E.g. a PDF.

|TODO|

## 8. Build

>Build Management with any Build System as Ant, Maven, Gradle, etc. (only Travis is perhaps not enough) Do e.g. generate Docs, call tests, etc. (it could be also disconnected from the project just to learn a build tool!) and CICD

|TODO|

## 9. UnitTests

>Integrate some nice unit tests in your Code to be integrated into the Build

|TODO|

## 10. IDE

>Use a good IDE and get fluent with it: e.g. IntelliJ. What are your favourite key shortcuts?!

### CHOSEN IDE: [VISUAL STUDIO COMMUNITY 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/)

&rarr; *shortcuts that I used the most*:
- ```ctrl + f``` (find)
- ```ctrl + .``` (creating definition from class to cpp file) 
- ```ctrl + c/v/x``` (copy/paste/cut)
- ```F5/F11/F10``` (debug/step into/step over)  
- ```ctrl + q``` (find functions/Code)

## 11. Functional programming

> prove that you have covered all functional aspects in your code as:
- only final data structures
- (mostly) side-effect-free functions
- the use of higher-order functions
- functions as parameters and return values  
- use closures / anonymous functions
- You can also do it outside of your project. Even in other languages such as F#, Clojure, Julia, etc.
